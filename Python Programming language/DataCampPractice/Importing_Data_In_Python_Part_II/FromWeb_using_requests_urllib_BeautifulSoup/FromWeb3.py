# Now that you've got your head and hands around making HTTP requests using the urllib package,
# you're going to figure out how to do the same using the higher-level requests library.
# Note that unlike in the previous exercises using urllib, you don't have to close the connection when using requests!

# Import package
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)
